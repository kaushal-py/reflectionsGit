Hello World.
I am proud to use GitHub for my Applications.
This is cool.

1 . How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I feel that old version are needed quite a lot when working on large applications.
It is critical to restore to any point of the file.

2 .  What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
	 like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does? 
Pros : - 
1. Ordered and logical commits are made.
2. Commits are organised and easier to find.
Cons :- 
1. One might forget to make an essential commit.

3 . Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
	files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Advantages are : - 
 It helps you to make concurrent changes in two files such as html and css
